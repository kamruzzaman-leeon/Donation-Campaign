# Donation Campaign

Welcome to the Donation Campaign project! This web application allows users to view and donate to various causes. The project is designed based on the Figma design provided, and it includes the following features:

## Features

### 1. Donation Cards on Home Page

- The Home page displays a grid of donation cards, showcasing a variety of causes.
- Each card is visually appealing with unique background colors and styling.
- Users can easily browse and select a cause they want to support.

### 2. Donation Details Page

- When a user clicks on a donation card, they are redirected to the Donation Details page.
- The Donation Details page provides in-depth information about the selected cause, including an image, title, description, and a donate button.
- The donation button background color matches the text color of the card on the Home page.

### 3. Responsive Design

- The website is fully responsive and adapts to different device sizes, including desktop, mobile, and tablet views.
- The responsive layout ensures that users can access and interact with the content on any device comfortably.

## Bonus Features

In addition to the main features, the project also includes several bonus features:

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for donations by entering categories in the search bar on the Home page. Clicking the search button filters and displays donations that match the specified category.

- **404 Route Handling**: The project has a custom 404 route that ensures users do not encounter "Page Not Found" errors when reloading the page or accessing undefined routes.
